# Specification Quality Checklist: Library API for Cursor History Access (002-library-api)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Strengths

1. **Clear User Stories**: Four well-prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
2. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 12 functional requirements covering all aspects of library functionality
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: All 6 criteria are quantifiable and technology-agnostic
4. **Well-Defined Scope**: Clear boundaries with "Out of Scope" section preventing scope creep
5. **Edge Cases Identified**: Six relevant edge cases covering error scenarios and special conditions
6. **Key Entities Defined**: Five main entities with clear relationships

### Notes

- No issues found during validation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
